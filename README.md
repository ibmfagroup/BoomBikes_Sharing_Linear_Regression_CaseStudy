# Project Name
BookBike Case Study: A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


## Table of Contents
1. Import Dataset and perform EDA and correlation
2. Data Preparation
3. Model building and evaluation



## General Information
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
- Based on the final model, top 3 features contributing are
-- temp, 0.4089
-- weathersit, -0.2936(Light Snow: -0.2353,Mist: -0.0583)
-- Year, 0.2332
- Final R-Squared and adjusted R-Squared
-- R-Squared for Training data: 0.82734
-- Adjusted R-Squared for Train dataset:  0.82423
-- R-Squared for Test data: 0.81136
-- Adjusted R-Squared for Test dataset:  0.80324
